## Hi! I'm currently looking for graduate jobs so feel free to reach out :)

### I am a Higher Technician in Multiplatform Applications Development and a Computer Science graduate from the University of Exeter. I pride myself on being a quick and adaptable learner. I began my development journey with mobile applications in Java and Kotlin, and have done extensive work in Python for general programming as well as for web applications using Django. I also learned C++ and digital signal processing for my dissertation, where I developed a real-time audio application for musicians. Currently, I am working with TypeScript and Next.js on my project, SightRead.
