## Hi! I'm currently looking for graduate jobs so feel free to reach out :)

### I am a Higher Technician in Multiplatform Applications Development and I'm in my final year of my Computer Science degree. I've coded mostly in Kotlin and Java until recently where I have been working on audio development with C++. My last project has involved making a VST with the JUCE framework for my dissertation.
